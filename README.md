# Flute-Website
A website for private flute lessons

As an avid flutist, I created a website where others are able to view my information and contact me if they would like to take private lessons. 

Currently, the frontend is complete but will have occasional edits to maximize user responsiveness. However, the contact form still requires the backend code to be completed so users may send a message and have that message pop up in my email.

A website for private flute lessons

As an avid flutist, I created a website where others are able to view my information and contact me if they would like to take private lessons. On the website, students can view my information and background and contact me via an email form where they are able to send me an email directly from the website. The server-side functionality of this form was utilizing using Node.JS and Nodemailer. 



Currently, the website is still very much a work in progress, with the main work being to make it much more responsive to varying device dimensions. Mainly, it is not very mobile-friendly. However, it does work well on computers and larger screens.
